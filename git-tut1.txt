What is Git?

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system. Git’s purpose is to keep track of projects and files as they change over time with manipulations happening from different users. Git stores information about the project’s progress on a repository. A repository has commits to the project or a set of references to the commits called heads. All this information is stored in the same folder as the project in a sub-folder called .git and will mostly be hidden by default in most systems.

So basically. Git keeps track of the changes a couple of people make on a single project and then merges the code where people have worked on different parts into one project. This way, when someone introduces a bug, you can track down the code that introduced the bug by going through the commits. Commits must be made to a project to tell git that you’re satisfied with the changes you’ve made and want to commit the changes into the main branch called master by default.

You can then upload the code to GitHub or BitBucket where authorised users can either view, pull the code or push changes.
